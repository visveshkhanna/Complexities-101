# Time and Space Complexity Demos

This repository contains two JavaScript files that demonstrate common **time complexities** and **space complexities** using simple algorithms and data structures, implemented in ES6 classes.

---

## Files

1. **TimeComplexitiesDemo.js**  
   - Demonstrates functions with the following time complexities:
     - **O(1)** — Constant Time  
     - **O(log N)** — Logarithmic Time  
     - **O(N)** — Linear Time  
     - **O(N log N)** — Linearithmic Time  
     - **O(N^2)** — Quadratic Time  
   - Includes a helper method `measureTime` to measure how long each function takes.

2. **SpaceComplexitiesDemo.js**  
   - Demonstrates functions with the following space complexities:
     - **O(1)** — Constant Space  
     - **O(log N)** — Logarithmic Space  
     - **O(N)** — Linear Space  
     - **O(N log N)** — Linearithmic Space (via Merge Sort discussion)  
     - **O(N^2)** — Quadratic Space (by creating an N×N matrix)  
   - Optionally logs approximate memory usage (in Chrome or Node.js).

## Usage

You can run each file separately in either **Node.js** or in the **browser console**.
